<h1>Possibly Identical Files</h1>
<p>
Found {{ itemcount }} file records that have identical hashes.
These are files, having different names or locations, that have
the same hash, and thus almost surely have the same file contents.
<p>
Even if the file contents are the same, the timestamps may differ,
because different files might have been touched at various times
in the past. However, file sizes should be identical.
<p>
Files with a hash of zero are files that the cataloger did not have
permissions to read. Perhaps the cataloger was not run as the root
user, and perhaps there were other security measures that prevented
file access.
