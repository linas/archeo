Meta: Sensory systems
---------------------
This README contains a meandering discussion of sensory systems.

If not already clear, this project is very much about the development of
a sensory system in Atomese. Conventional human sensory systems are sound
and vision, but of course, science offers many more: wind velocity,
temperature, density and composition. These are fields, usually in 3D
space. But there are also phylogenetics, movement of human populations
and the intermingling of their genetic content, their cultural content,
the local spoken dialect, customs, beleifs in gods. The later are all
complex relationship networks that change over time, and their
characterization and understanding is a modern scientific undertaking.

### A simple, concrete network
A filesstem, especially a filesystem changing over time, offers a simple,
immediate, direct example of a complex network whose structure can be
explored. Conventionally, this is done with file browsers, or command
line tools like `cd` and `ls`. More recently, web browsers allow point
by point inspection of individual web pages. Social networks, such as
facebook or twitter, allow point-by-point inspection of more abstract
data.

The task for an AGI is how to intake, onboard and process sensory
information from an exterior world, and thereby "understand" what is
going on "out there". The relation between "self" and "outside world"
is mediated by the sensations. The meta question that I would like to
explore here is the process and act of sensing the environment.

To do this, I can blather on abstractly. Or I can write code to actually
do it. The goal of using the file system as an "external environment"
that can be observed is that it avoids the pitfalls of know-it-all AI
approaches. Vision and sound are too obvious, and too easily dismissed.
Natural langauge text is susceptible to LLM approaches all to easily;
and so "reading" is not conventinoally understood to be a sensory act.
The filesystem provides the small, simple, direct and easy-to-work-with
example of a network that can be sensed.

### The engineering trap
The filesystem is a well-understood concept, and so it is all to easy
to fall into the enginering trap: we already know what we want, so all
we have to do is to write some shims, some connectors, some file crawlers
and content digesters, and bingo, done! This is a trap, because I am
doing all the thinking, not the AGI: I decide what is important, how
things fit together, how to represent file structures in Atomese. The
"I" here is the software-writing engineer and developer. The goal here
is to discover a colleciton of sensory algorithms that can process
network information in the abstract, without my intervention as designer.

Sadly, I am falling into that trap. I do not yet understand the generic
sensory process sufficiently to just write generic code. So I am very
much in the middle of hand-crafting a very specific system, targeting
the filesystem. Someday, it can be replicated and generalized to social
networks, genetic networks, economic networks, and the like. But right
now, I don't yet understand the general principles, so I have to muddle
along.

As far as I know, no one has done this. We don't have some generic
network analyzer that can be deployed for electrical circuits,
protein-gene reactomes, financial transactions and historical events.

Eventually, I hope to have some pearls of wisdom here about neural nets,
but not yet. I have the vague inkling that neural nets do provide a
means for building a generic network analyzer, but I don't know anything
about that, yet.
