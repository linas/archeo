Meta: Sensory systems
---------------------
This README contains a meandering discussion of sensory systems.

If not already clear, this project is very much about the development of
a sensory system in Atomese. Conventional human sensory systems are sound
and vision, but of course, science offers many more: wind velocity,
temperature, density and composition. These are fields, usually in 3D
space. But there are also phylogenetics, movement of human populations
and the intermingling of their genetic content, their cultural content,
the local spoken dialect, customs, beleifs in gods. The later are all
complex relationship networks that change over time, and their
characterization and understanding is a modern scientific undertaking.

A filesstem, especially a filesystem changing over time, offers a simple,
immediate, direct example of a complex network whose structure can be
explored. Conventionally, this is done with file browsers, or command
line tools like `cd` and `ls`. More recently, web browsers allow point
by point inspection of individual web pages. Social networks, such as
facebook or twitter, allow point-by-point inspection of more abstract
data.

The task for an AGI is how to intake, onboard and process sensory
information from an exterior world, and thereby "understand" what is
going on "out there". The relation between "self" and "outside world"
is mediated by the sensations. The meta question that I would like to
explore here is the process and act of sensing the environment.

To do this, I can blather on abstractly. Or I can write code to actually
do it. The goal of using the file system as an "external environment"
that can be observed is that it avoids the pitfalls of know-it-all AI
approaches. Vision and sound are too obvious, and too easily dismissed.
Natural langauge text is susceptible to LLM approaches all to easily;
and so "reading" is not conventinoally understood to be a sensory act.
The filesystem provides the small, simple, direct and easy-to-work-with
example of a network that can be sensed.
