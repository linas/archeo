# This has the form of a labelled directed graph edge.
# In ASCII graphics:

#                      "some edge label"
#    "from vertex" ------------------------> "to vertex"
#
# which in Atomese, becomes
#
#    (Edge (Predicate "some edge label")
#            (List (Item "from vertex") (Item "to vertex")))
#
# and for python, the parens get re-arranged and commas are inserted:
#
#    Edge (Predicate ("some edge label"),
#          List (Item ("from vertex"), Item ("to vertex")))

# Photographs are "stored" (or can be found at) URL locations.
# The relationship between the URL location and the file name can
# be indicated with an arrow. (This is one of many ways.)
