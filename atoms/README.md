AtomSpace Version
-----------------
After prototyping versin 0.0.6 in python+flask+sqlite3, I've decided
to continue the rest of the development using the AtomSpace instead of
sqlite3, but keeping the python+flask tech stack. The reason for this
change is given in the [similarity-README](../src/similarity/README.md).

This directory contains (will contain) the new version. Nothing here,
yet.
